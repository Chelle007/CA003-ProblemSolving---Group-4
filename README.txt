=== PREQUISITE before running EchoFlowerApp.py ===

1. set the scale to 125% and display resolution to 1920 x 1080 on Settings
2. install pip (if not installed yet)
3. install customtkinter
4. install packaging
5. install pillow
6. install TT Commons Medium(Font)

*We also provide an exe file in case the code can not be executed.

=== Setting scale to 125% and display resolution to 1920 x 1080 on Settings ===

(For Windows)
1. Go to Settings > System > Display > Scale&Layout
2. Change 'scale' to 125%
3. Change 'display resolution' to 1920 x 1080

(For Mac OS)
1. Go to System Preferences > Displays
2. The 'Default for display' is usually 1920 x 1080 but if it is not, it can be changed by clicking 'Scaled' option and choosing 1920 x 1080.

*The size of widgets and text may look different on different scales and display resolutions since the design size is fixed. Some widgets may be misplaced on other scales and resolutions too. We are sorry for the inconvenience, we didn't realize this problem until the last few days before deadline, so we didn't have enough time to change the whole code into responsive user interface.
